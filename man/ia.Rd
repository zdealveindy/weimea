\arguments{
\item{sitspe}{Compositional matrix (samples x species).}
}
\description{
Creates distance matrix based on Whittaker's index of association, which reflects the dissimilarities between weighted means of species attributes calculated for individual samples, which can be attributed to differences in species composition. The metric is Manhattan-type distance calculated on species profiles (i.e. on community matrix with rows standardized to row-totals).
