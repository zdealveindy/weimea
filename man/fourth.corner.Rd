\description{
calculates the fourth-corner statistic (according to Legendre et al. 1997, compiled according to Peres-Neto et al. 2012)
}
\details{
Chessel's version of the fourth corner statistic has been introduced by Peres-Neto et al. (2016), to rescale the fourth corner r statistic into the range of -1 and 1. This is achieved by dividing the observed fourth corner r by square root of the first eigenvalue for correspondance analysis of L (sitspe) matrix.
